# Global Layoffs During COVID-19 - SQL

## Objectives

The project "Global Layoffs During COVID-19 - SQL" aims to analyze layoff data in relation to economic indicators during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary objectives include:

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Implement advanced SQL queries to clean and preprocess raw data, addressing missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies across over 1000 records.
- **Data Integration**: Develop complex SQL joins and subqueries to merge layoff data with relevant economic indicators, revealing correlations between industry sectors and economic factors.
- **Trend Analysis**: Conduct time-series analysis using SQL window functions to track layoff trends across different regions and industries throughout the pandemic.

## Impact

The impact of this project is significant in several ways:

- **Understanding Economic Impact**: By analyzing layoffs in conjunction with economic indicators, stakeholders can gain insights into how various sectors were affected by the pandemic, aiding in future preparedness and response strategies.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: The findings can inform policymakers, businesses, and economists about the relationship between economic conditions and employment trends, facilitating better decision-making.
- **Skill Demonstration**: The project showcases proficiency in SQL, particularly in data cleaning, integration, and analysis, which are essential skills in the field of data analytics.

## Method

The methodology for this project encompasses several key steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Use SQL queries to identify and handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies within the dataset.
   - Implement techniques such as `COALESCE` for missing values and `DISTINCT` for duplicates to ensure a clean dataset.

2. **Data Integration**:
   - Develop complex SQL joins (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) to merge layoff data with economic indicators from other tables.
   - Use subqueries to extract relevant economic metrics that correlate with layoff data.

3. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Conduct time-series analysis using SQL window functions (e.g., `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `SUM() OVER()`) to track layoff trends over time.
   - Analyze variations in layoffs across different regions and industries by grouping data appropriately.
  

This structured approach ensures that the project meets its objectives while providing valuable insights into global layoffs


## Key Findings

   * The most affected companies are the big tech firms, such as Google, Meta, Microsoft and others.
   * The companies with the highest number of layoffs are those that provide services directly to consumers.
   * Even though the big tech companies laid off the highest number of employees, they are among those with the lowest percentage of layoffs.
